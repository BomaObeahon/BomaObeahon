## Hi, I'm Boma 👋

A Data Analyst learning by breaking things and then frantically trying to fix them 😁😉. That’s how I grow — by experimenting, making mistakes, and finding smarter ways to solve problems.

I love working with data because it feels like solving puzzles that actually matter. Whether it’s spotting trends, building dashboards, or uncovering insights that help businesses grow, I enjoy turning numbers into something people can understand and act on.
